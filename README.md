# WhatsApp Desktop

_WhatsApp Desktop_ is an experimental project heavily inspired by [Gustavo Gonzalez's WhatsDesk](https://gitlab.com/zerkc/whatsdesk), aiming to bring WhatsApp to desktop platforms, namely Linux and macOS, through the help of [Electron.js](https://www.electronjs.org/).

## Usage

No-nonsense setup: install dependencies and run the app.

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Run in development mode
yarn run start
```

## Motivation

I don't like messy and disorganized code, with lots of meaningless stuff floating midair; that's how the original project felt like. I'm just trying to clean it up and enforce better coding practices.
